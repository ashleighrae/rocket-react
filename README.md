# 🚀 Rocket React

**Rocket React** is a gamified, mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) application designed for use in classrooms. Built using **React Native** and **Firebase**, it was developed by **Ashleigh-Rae O’Neill** as part of her Honours thesis in collaboration with Year 8 students and teachers.

Unlike conventional language apps, Rocket React is purposefully designed to embrace the **social and physical environment** of classrooms—transforming language learning into a **collaborative, performative experience** that goes beyond the screen.

## 📱 Requirements

To test Rocket React properly, you’ll need:

- **Two mobile devices** (iOS or Android) with the **Expo Go** app installed  
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your development machine  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashleighrae/rocket-react.git
   cd rocket-react
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

4. **Open the app on devices**

   - Open the **Expo Go** app on each mobile device.
   - Scan the QR code shown in your terminal or browser.
   - Using **two devices** is essential to test real-time multiplayer functionality.

## 📚 Research Context

While there are many web-based applications to support language learning, few are designed specifically for—or take advantage of—the **social and physical contexts of classrooms**.

**Rocket React** was designed, developed, and deployed solely by **Ashleigh-Rae O’Neill** as part of her Honours research project. It was co-designed with **71 Year 8 German students** and **6 language teachers** to create a learning tool grounded in real classroom needs.

Unlike traditional apps, Rocket React does not embed social features like chat or friend lists. Instead, it treats the **classroom itself as a dynamic, collaborative environment**.

### Key design outcomes:
- ✏️ Co-located collaboration on shared tasks  
- 🗣️ Out-loud, performative interactions that enhance engagement  
- 👀 Vicarious learning through observation and peer participation
